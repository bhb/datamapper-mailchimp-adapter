== DESCRIPTION:

A Datamapper adapter to access the MailChimp mailing list web services.  BIG work in progress at the moment, as this is my first time digging into DM adapters.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

This adapter currently supported the following features:
   - create will add a user to a specific MailChimp mailing list
   - delete will remove a user from a specific MailChimp mailing list
   - read_one will read the information for one user on a particular mailing
   - read_all will read the information for all users on a particular mailing list
   - udpdate will update a user's information on a particular list

Still plenty to do and test (and write tests for dood mcgee's sakes)

== SYNOPSIS:
  Setup database.yml with a mailchimp adapter:

  adapter:  mailchimp
  database: ''
  username: mailchimp_user
  password: mailchimp_password
  mailing_list_id: list_id (optional - can specify in code as well) 
  host:  localhost

  Create a model that will hold attributes required by MailChimp APIs:
class Mailee
  include DataMapper::Resource


  property :id, String, :serial => true, :key => true, :field => :_id
  property :first_name, String
  property :last_name, String
  property :email, String
  property :mailing_list_id, String

   #callback method used by adapter to build mail merge info for MailChimp
   def build_mail_merge()
      {"EMAIL" => self.email, "FNAME" => self.first_name, "LNAME" => self.last_name }
   end
end

  Try it out....merb -i, for instance:
  m = Mailee.new
  m.first_name = 'dood'
  m.last_name = 'mcgee'
  m.email = 'doodmcgee@yahoo.com'
  m.mailing_list_id = '11232131231'
  m.create

  If it works, dood mcgee should get an opt-in email

== REQUIREMENTS:

 - Implement and test basic adapter operations
 - Implement full Mail Chimp API 

== INSTALL:

Download from github and run rake install
